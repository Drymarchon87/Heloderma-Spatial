"Table 4 | Home range overlap of within and among sexes between individuals using 100% MCPs at Stone Canyon. Male:Male overlap occurred in only two pairs of male home ranges, M14:M69 and M119:M215 at 0.5 and 19.5 ha. respectivley, and were therefore not included in the table. Net overlap is total area contributing to overlap independent of that area shared by by multiple lizards. Proportion is the proportion of yearly home range area of inidviduals shared with other lizards. There was considerable female home range  overlap with other females as well as with male home ranges.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,"Table 5 | Home range overlap of within and among sexes between individuals using 100% MCPs at Owl Head Buttes.

Net overlap is total area contributing to overlap independent of that area shared by by multiple lizards. Proportion is the proportion of yearly home range area of inidviduals shared with other lizards.
